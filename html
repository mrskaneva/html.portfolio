        <h2 class="about-h1">ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p class="about-p">Hello! I'm Whiskers, a curious calico cat with a passion for coding and a love for learning new technologies. When I’m not napping in cozy spots or chasing laser pointers, I’m hard at work experimenting with coding languages and developing apps and websites. I believe in the power of creativity and logic coming together, and I’m on a mission to combine my love for technology with my natural feline curiosity.

            I’m currently learning how to create functional, responsive websites and intuitive mobile apps. While I might be a cat, I have the patience and determination to get things done right—whether it’s debugging my code or designing the perfect user interface (UI).</p>

                    <li>JavaScript: I’m pouncing on dynamic elements and making websites come to life with interactive features.</li>
                    <li>Swift: I’ve just started learning Swift to develop apps that are as sleek as my fur!</li>
                    <li>Python: For the more complex tasks, Python is my go-to for creating scripts and exploring machine learning (I’m also considering using it for detecting the best spots for sunbathing).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
           <div class="list-2"><h3>Frameworks & Tools:</h3>

                <li>GitHub: All my projects are safely stored and managed, with commits and versions just like my well-organized napping spots.</li>

                <li><b>Purrfect Portfolio</b><br><br>
                    My first full-stack website project
                    I created a portfolio website that displays my projects, code snippets, and a fun section about my love for coding and tech. It features smooth animations, responsive design, and a cat-themed UI with a built-in purring sound when you hover over my profile picture!
                    Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Cat-ify Your Website</b><br><br>
                    This app allows users to upload their photos and overlay cute cat stickers, paws, and whiskers. It’s a fun way to personalize websites and social media!
                    Tech Stack: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and a bit of creativity with image processing.
                </li> 
                <br>
                <li><b>Kitty Calorie Tracker</b> <br><br>
                    An app to track your cat's meals and playtime
I’m developing an app that allows pet owners to log their cat’s meals, snacks, and playtime. It provides recommendations for healthy food portions and suggests fun activities to keep cats active.
Tech Stack: Swift (for iOS), Firebase (for data storage)
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Whiskers’ Web Scraper</b><br><br>
                    Scraping the web for the latest in cat news
I’ve made a simple web scraper that pulls the latest news articles on cats and displays them in a neat layout. It’s a fun project I built to practice my Python skills!
Tech Stack: Python, BeautifulSoup, Flask
